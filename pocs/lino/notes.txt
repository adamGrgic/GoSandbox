Intro 1/21/2025
create a cli app that will be ran on terminal start up

it will have notion like capabilities with the ability to create or implement
custom workflows types of activities reminders, todos, sidenotes

should be capable of doing other helpful tasks, one that comes to mind is
creating sample json data

at this point I'm not sure how much is going to be configurable versus oob
(things you can simply setup in the terminal) will have to play around with
it and use it to my liking

Ultimately I envision this as a server application that runs continuously and
then options to connect to server and do a bunch of pre made commands. Geared
more towards personal use / things that would be helpful to implement in your
daily life.
